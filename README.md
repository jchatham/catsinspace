This is the front-end of an application that won my team a second place award for a NASA codeathon and the team, without myself, won first place during the following year. 

The application consists of a HTML frontend that places REST calls to the backend to allow voting on if a particular space image looks like a cat and displays the current count online. Used some free hosting plan, IIRC it was on AWS free tier. I don't recall if I used the tag NASA or multiple tags like NASA/ISS, but the database just had upvotes and downvotes with a keygen on MySQL. I honestly could redo the DDL, it's very simple, but the script to populate it was in Python and I'm junior at best in that language. 

This is from my time in school and I indeed did not check in the DDL and also did not add the script that pulled all the files from Flickr. To my surprise Flickr still exists.
