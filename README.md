This is the front-end of an application that won my team a second place award for a NASA codeathon and the team, without myself, won first place during the following year. 

The application consists of a HTML frontend that places REST calls to the backend to allow voting on if a particular space image looks like a cat and displays the current count online. Used some free hosting plan, IIRC it was on AWS free tier. I don't recall if I used the tag NASA or multiple tags like NASA/ISS, but the database just had upvotes and downvotes with a keygen on MySQL. It was a very simple DDL. I honestly could redo the DDL, it's very simple, but the script to populate it was in Python and I'm junior at best in that language. I was the only programmer on this project and another group member drew the cat images. 

This is from my time in school and I indeed did not check in the DDL and also did not add the script that pulled all the files from Flickr. To my surprise Flickr still exists. 

I might try getting this hosted and also updating the project. Go with some MVC framework and use an IDE this time. PHP is a very easy language and we used it in school whenever we had a project that was group work and we were able to choose the tech stack. My program was very group focused, so choosing an easy language that wasn't even taught at the school made it so that people who weren't as good at programming could contribute.
