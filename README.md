This is the front-end of an application that won my team a second place award for a NASA codeathon and the team, without myself, won first place during the next year. 

The application consists of a HTML frontend that places REST calls to the backend to allow voting on if a particular space image looks like a cat and displays the current count online. Used some free hosting plan, IIRC it was on AWS free tier. 

This is from my time in school and I indeed did not check in the DDL and also did not add the script that pulled all the files from Flickr. To my surprise Flickr still exists.
